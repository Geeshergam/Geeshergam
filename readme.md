## **Hi**

##### I consider myself a curious person, many things call my attention, of course, always keeping a focus on sectors that are productive and constant learning. My interests are related to Humanism, Music and Arts, I usually learn whatever I can, and better if it is in the area of technology, which I have been related to since I was a child, from disassembling the hardware of a desktop PC, until now... Entering the world of programming and working on personal projects, looking to grow professionally.
